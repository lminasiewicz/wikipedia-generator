I learned PyTorch from scratch for this project.
See sources at sources.txt (same directory as README)

This is a Transformer for text generation. As of the current commit, I am attempting to make it a text generator
for wikipedia articles, or otherwise definitions. This may change in the future depending on the interactions
between the model and the dataset.
